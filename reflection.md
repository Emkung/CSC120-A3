- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
7-9 tuesday, 7-9 wednesday, 3-5 monday
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
complicated, explecially with the decalring variable how it must have a type.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think the declaring variable with specific types is very different from python especially as each type has their own specific methods. It is a lot more complicated than python. On the other hand some stuff that are pretty similar are loops and print statement. Even though, their syntax changed at the core they are still very similar. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What didn't work is just trying to brute force it alone. I think working together with some people later on really helped me and I would suggest others to do the same.
